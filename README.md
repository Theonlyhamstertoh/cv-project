# Reflection

Wow was this project more complicated and time-consuming than I have originally planned. A lot of work was needed to be dealt that I never plan. My average understanding of the states and the new way of utilizing JSX brought me a great deal of confusion and mess. Knowing that I can move on brings me relief. I hope to carry over in my next project **better organization, learn more about git and commiting more, ask for questions, and do better planning.**

I'M FREE FROM THIS PROJECT.

Plan for next project
I would like to spend time doing some cooler things. Enough of the forms. Time to play music!
